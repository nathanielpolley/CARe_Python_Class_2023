Homework Assignment 2 : Beginner Level - FASTA File Parsing with Biopython

Objective:
Introduce students to basic file handling, parsing of FASTA format files using Biopython, and data extraction into a CSV file.

Tasks:

1. Create a Python script that reads a FASTA file containing DNA sequences (sequences_beginner.fasta). The file should have multiple sequence entries.

2. Write a class FastaParser with a method parse_file that reads the FASTA file using Biopython's SeqIO module and extracts the following information for each sequence:
Sequence name
Sequence description
Sequence length
GC content (percentage of Gs and Cs)
Molecular weight of the sequence

3. Use a for loop to iterate through the sequences and print the sequence names, descriptions, lengths, GC content, and molecular weights to the console.

4. Modify the FastaParser class to write the sequence names, descriptions, lengths, GC content, and molecular weights to a CSV file named "ex_2_beginner_submit.csv".

Submission:
Submit the Python script, the CSV file containing the specified data points, and any relevant comments explaining the code.

Homework Assignment 2 : Advanced Level - FASTA File Analysis with Object Polymorphism and Protein Translation

Objective:
Introduce students to advanced object-oriented concepts, including polymorphism, and perform transcription and translation on various biological sequences, with a final goal of printing out a CSV file containing the protein translation data.

Tasks:

1. Create a Python script that reads a FASTA file containing DNA sequences. The file should have multiple sequence entries.

2. Write a base class Sequence with the following attributes and methods:
Attributes:
Sequence name
Sequence description
Sequence data
Methods:
Calculate sequence length
Calculate GC content
Abstract methods for transcription and translation

3. Create subclasses for DNASequence, RNASequence, and ProteinSequence that inherit from the Sequence class. Implement the abstract methods for transcription and translation in each subclass:
DNASequence should transcribe to an RNA sequence.
RNASequence should translate to a protein sequence.
ProteinSequence should have a method to calculate molecular weight.

4. Write a class FastaParser that reads the FASTA file using Biopython's SeqIO module and creates instances of the appropriate sequence type (DNA, RNA, or Protein).

5. Use polymorphism within the FastaParser class to define a common method that transcribes DNA sequences into RNA sequences and translates RNA sequences into protein sequences.

6. Write a for loop that processes each sequence and prints the following information to the console:
Sequence name
Sequence description
DNA sequence
Sequence length
GC content 
RNA transcript
Protein translation
Molecular weight (for Protein sequences)

7. Modify the FastaParser class to write the information mentioned above to a CSV file ex_2_advanced_submission.csv.

Submission:
Submit the Python script, the CSV file containing the specified data points and protein translations, and any relevant comments explaining the code.

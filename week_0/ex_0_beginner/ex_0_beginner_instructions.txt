The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

Hi! My name is Emmanuella Bassey, and I am from Houston, TX. I enjoy discovering new music, playing volleyball, and completing DIY projects. Through learning python, my goal is to be able to sharpen my bioinformatics skills to potentially work for an industry company with hands in science + medicine.

The last time I was in a place without a computer available was when I went to a city called 'Lourdes' here in France with some other girls from a summer research program. We were able to take in the beauty and religious history of the place and put flowers in each other's hair upon finding a nice patch. It was a peaceful time!

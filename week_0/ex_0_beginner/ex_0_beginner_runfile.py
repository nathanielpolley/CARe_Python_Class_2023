While I'm well aware that devices like microwave ovens and thermostats are essentially embedded computers, my camping experience was a deliberate break from all forms of digital technology. During that time, I disconnected from screens and gadgets, choosing instead to immerse myself in the natural world. It was a welcome escape and a chance to appreciate the beauty of the outdoors without any technological distractions.")

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

I'm Dimitra, a second year Mater's student who loves traveling and dreaming! I study in France and my goal is to work on cancer research. Learning a programming language will help me to better understand how to analyze my results and how to work faster and more efficiently.

The last time I was without a computer available was during this summer on an island in Greece! Of course this happened just because my phone was dead and I left it charging, but the result is what matters! I spent some hours only with my book and beers :)

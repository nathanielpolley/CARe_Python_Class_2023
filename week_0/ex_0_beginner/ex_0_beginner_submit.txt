The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

My name is LÃ©o, I'm 22 and after struggling being a CARe master student (yeah coding part) I'm a basketball addict and I love food.
I would love to learn how to correctly use python as I loved coding plugins on Minecraft 10 years ago.
Plus, It would help my biologist career as I'm doing an internship at Mitchell Lazar Lab at UPenn and I'm working on circadian rhythms.
It generates so much data that adding machine learning could relief my fingers from copy/paste in excel files...
Well, I'm really enthusiast learning python the proper way and I'll do my best to succeed!

Well with that being said I guess I can't name any place and date

Beginner Homework Assignments week 1 (0.5 points):

Apply basic Python list iteration concepts to analyze microbial population data:

-Create a Python script that defines a list of microbial population counts (e.g., [100, 200, 150, 300, 50]) for five
        consecutive days.

-Calculate and print the following statistics using list operations and loops:
        Average population count.
        Maximum population count.
        Minimum population count.

-Use a for loop to iterate through the population counts and identify days when the population exceeds 200. Print out
        the day numbers when this occurs.
-Submit the Python runfile with comments explaining each step and the results of your calculations in the submit file.

Intermediate Homework Assignments week 1 (1.5 points):

Apply intermediate Python dictionary iteration concepts to analyze microbial diversity data:

-Create a Python script that defines a dictionary where the keys represent different microbial species
        (e.g., "Bacteria", "Archaea", "Fungi") and the values represent the number of samples collected for each species
        (e.g., {"Bacteria": 20, "Archaea": 15, "Fungi": 10}).
-Implement a loop to calculate and print the total number of samples collected across all species.
-Use a list comprehension to create a list of microbial species with sample counts greater than 15.
-Create a function that takes the species dictionary and a new species name as input. The function should add the new
        species to the dictionary with an initial count of 1 if the species is not already present. If the species is
        already in the dictionary, increase its count by 1.
-Implement a while loop to continuously prompt the user for new species names to add to the dictionary until they
        choose to stop it.
-Print out to the console the entirety of the dictionary including the changes made by the user.
-Please provide the Python runfile with comments explaining each step and the results of your calculations
        in the submit file.

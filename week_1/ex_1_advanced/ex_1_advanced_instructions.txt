Advanced Homework Assignments week 1 (2 points):

Handling text file input/output, dictionaries with lists as values, and advanced string manipulation:

looking at 60 diff references on 2 diff lists
we want to iterate through all and check the differences between then (use the set and interaction function!!!)
you also want to turn all of the data in the file into a dictionary. iterate through all of them, and then if they are the say GOOD and iterate into a certain list
have a separate list for

-Your colleague has for you two text files containing a list of 60 references for a manuscript, and each reference must
        be identical. You notice that she has been searching for differences between the two files by hand, and you feel
        bad since she has been at it all day. You try giving commands for ChatGPT to execute this task, but since they
        have made ChatGPT dumber since its release last year in order to sell the "premium" version, ChatGPT has done
        everything but the desired task. Now, you must write a Python script yourself in order to alleviate all suffering.
-Read in the files references_1.txt and references_2.txt from the working directory
-Initialize two dictionaries containing the reference number (as it appears on the file) as the key and the string of the
        reference as the value. For simplification, please remove all whitespace (" ") within each entry.
-Create a new dictionary named "status" enumerated 1-60 for each of the entries
-Iterate through the two reference dictionaries using a for loop, if the strings of the references match exactly,
        append a list containing the word ["GOOD"] to the value of the corresponding reference number key in the
        dictionary "status". If a difference between the two references is detected, append to the dictionary a list
        of all discontinuities as a list of strings in respect to references_1. Append to a list even if only one
        difference exits.

        Example: References_1 Line 56-"Maryhadalittlelamb", References_2 Line 56-"Jacobhadalittlegoat"
        status["56"] -> ["Mary", "lamb"]

-Write out a file named "ex_1_advanced_submit.txt" in the following format:
        1 : GOOD
        2 : GOOD
        ...
        56 : Mary, lamb

-Push both the created submit file and your commented runfile to GitHub to make a pull request.

-PS -- I have not done this task myself, so I am counting on YOU to come up with a good idea (as is real life).
        Let me know if anything goes wrong in the process.
